# Predicting Plant Growth Stages Using Power BI

## 📘 Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes and visualizes how environmental and management factors impact plant growth milestones.
The dataset includes variables like soil type, temperature, humidity, sunlight hours, water frequency, and fertilizer type.

By building interactive dashboards and insightful visualizations, the project aims to help agricultural planners and greenhouse managers identify optimal growing conditions and improve resource allocation.
